# MYMOID PHP SDK

## Usage Instructions

To harness the full potential of the MYMOID PHP SDK, follow these steps meticulously:

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have installed on your system a version of PHP between 7.2.5 and 7.4.33.

2. **Repository Cloning:** Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine.

3. **Navigation:** Enter the directory of the cloned repository using your command line interface of choice.

4. **Dependency Installation:** Execute the command `composer install` to install all necessary dependencies. If you don't have Composer installed already, fret not! Simply refer to [Composer's official website](https://getcomposer.org/download/) for hassle-free installation instructions.

5. **Exploring Examples:** Delve into the "examples" folder where a treasure trove of demonstration awaits.

6. **Configuration:** Each example file requires configuration of specific parameters. Dive into the code, tweak as needed, and ensure to save your changes.

7. **Execution:** Finally, unleash the power of the SDK by executing each example with the command `php example_file_name.php`. For instance, if you're looking to create a payment, invoke `php createpayment.php`. Don't forget, if you're at the root directory of the cloned repository, prepend `/examples/` to the file name, like so: `php /examples/createpayment.php`.

Embark on your journey with the MYMOID PHP SDK, and let your imagination soar!
